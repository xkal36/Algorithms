"""
The knightâ€™s tour puzzle is played on 
a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. 
The object of the puzzle is to find a sequence of 
moves that allow the knight to visit every square 
on the board exactly once. One such sequence is called a "tour".

The upper bound on the number of possible 
legal tours for an eight-by-eight chessboard 
is known to be 1.305 x 10**35; however, there are even more possible dead ends.

We solve the problem using two main steps:

1. Represent the legal moves of a knight on a chessboard as a graph.

2. Use a graph algorithm to find a path of length 
rows Ã— columns âˆ’ 1 where every vertex on the graph is visited exactly once.
Depth first search is used to do this.
